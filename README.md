### Unsolved Problems/Hurdles

I would have liked to include a total score feature to sum the scores from individual trivia categories.
The default browser alert box is a bit hideous. I would have liked to use a better alternative but wanted to stick to vanilla javascript without external aids.
I would have liked to have more styling, though I do like the uncluttered spartan look.
